# Cetacean Photogrammetry API

This API allows a user to upload aerial images of whales and they will be automatically identified by species and photogrammetrically measured. Currently the model is trained on humpback, blue, and minke whales. If you have imagery of additional species we would be thrilled to add these species to this model.

A manuscript describing this work is currently under review at Methods in Ecology and Evolution. Upon publication all code for model development and analysis and all necessary data will be open sourced.

This work is supported by Microsoft AI for Earth (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/ai-for-earth) and is running in Azure Container Instances (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-instances/).
